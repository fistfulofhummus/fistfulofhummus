## 🧠 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional with **3+ years of experience**, primarily in **SOC environments**, specializing in **penetration testing** and **security engineering**.

My work focuses on understanding how real adversaries operate and using that knowledge to improve detection, response, and overall security posture.

I’ve conducted vulnerability assessments across:

- 🌐 Web Applications  
- 🖧 Networks *(my favorite)*  
- 📱 Mobile Platforms  
- ☁️ Cloud Environments  

My experience goes beyond traditional pentesting and includes:

- 🔴 Adversary simulation  
- 🟣 Purple team collaboration  
- 🧠 Threat modeling  
- 🛡️ IDS / IPS deployment  
- 🤖 SOAR implementation  
- 🎭 Social engineering  
- 🚪 Physical penetration testing

## 🟣 Purple Team Philosophy

I believe effective security lives in the feedback loop between offense and defense.

- Simulate real adversaries  
- Validate detections  
- Reduce false positives  
- Improve signal quality  
- Measure what actually matters  

If it doesn’t improve detection or resilience, it’s just noise.
