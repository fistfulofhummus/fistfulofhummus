# About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional with **3+ years of experience**, primarily in **SOC environments**, specializing in **penetration testing** and **security engineering**.

My focus is operating in the **space between red and blue** — understanding how adversaries actually behave, then using that knowledge to improve **detection, response, and a environments resiliance** to cyberatttacks.

I’ve conducted security assessments across:

- 🌐 Web Applications  
- 🖧 Networks *(my favorite)*  
- 📱 Mobile Platforms  
- ☁️ Cloud Environments  

Beyond traditional pentesting, my work includes:

- 🔴 Adversary emulation  
- 🛡️ IDS / IPS engineering  
- 🤖 SOAR automation  
- 🎭 Social engineering  
- 🚪 Physical penetration testing  (I am decent with lockpicks)
