# About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional with **3+ years of experience**, primarily in **SOC environments**, specializing in **penetration testing** and **security engineering**.

I've been in environments where real alerts get ignored and only **hopes and illusions** of security were being sold. I like to go the extra step and actually test the current setup being used.

I’ve conducted security assessments across:

- 🌐 Web Apps
- 🖧 Networks *(AD my beloved)*  
- 📱 Mobile Platforms  
- ☁️ Cloud Environments  

Beyond traditional pentesting, my work includes:

- 🔴 Adversary emulation  
- 🛡️ IDS / IPS engineering  
- 🤖 SOAR automation  
- 🎭 Social engineering  
- 🚪 Physical penetration testing  (I am decent with lockpicks)
